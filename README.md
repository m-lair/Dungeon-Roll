if you are going to make a new branch please make it from develop and then we can merge it from there up the stream.
no branch naming convention needed. feel free to work on whatever features or functions or screens you want at this point until we get something more tangable.
follow the figma for general outline of the UI but everything is also subject to change if we want to
